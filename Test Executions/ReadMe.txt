Ni Hao! Hola! Konnichiwa! Como estais?

In the Basic Rules folder, we tested the executions of the basic rules:
	- Evolution
	- Communications: Send-in
	- Communications: Send-out
	- Communications: Antiport

In the Non-Determinism folder, we tested the Non-Determinism capability of the rules in the case that two (or more) rules can be applied on an object:
1. ex2.pli - ex2.txt: Maximal Parallelism and Non-Determinism between send-out and antiport - with respect to lack of energy
2. example.pli - ex.txt : Nondeterminism yielding to either non-halting or halting configuration


In the test for Maximal Parallelism, we have tested if all the objects that can be applied will be applied:


NP Problems contains programs for
	1. 3-sat problem : 3sat.pli
	2. Vertex Cover Problem : vertexCover1.pli
